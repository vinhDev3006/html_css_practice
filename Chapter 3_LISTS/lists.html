            <dt>Crewmate</dt>
            <dd>A crewmate is one of the players on a spaceship or facility who is tasked with completing various tasks in order to maintain the ship's operations and keep it running smoothly. The crewmates must work together to identify and vote off any players who are suspected of being impostors, who are trying to sabotage the ship and kill the crewmates. Crewmates can win the game by completing all their tasks before the impostors can kill them all, or by successfully identifying and voting off all the impostors.</dd>

            <dt>Imposter</dt>
            <dd>An impostor is a player who is secretly working against the rest of the crew. The impostor's goal is to sabotage the spaceship or facility, and to kill off the crewmates one by one without getting caught. The impostor can use various tactics to deceive and mislead the crewmates, such as pretending to perform tasks or creating false alibis. The impostor can also use the vents to move around the ship quickly and avoid being seen. The game is won by the impostors if they manage to kill enough crewmates or if they successfully sabotage the ship to the point where it becomes impossible for the remaining crewmates to complete their tasks. On the other hand, the crewmates win if they are able to identify and vote off all the impostors, or if they manage to complete all their tasks before the impostors can kill them all.</dd>
