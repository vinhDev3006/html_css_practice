# html_css_practice
Welcome to my repository where I practice HTML and CSS coding! Although I'm not a web developer, I'm fascinated by the design and structure of websites and have taken it upon myself to learn more about creating them.

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the backbone of every website, providing the structure and content that browsers use to render web pages. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to describe the presentation of HTML documents, including layout, colors, and fonts.

Within this repository, you will find a collection of HTML and CSS files that I have created and customized. Some of the projects include simple web pages with headings, paragraphs, images, and links. Others involve more advanced styling with custom fonts, colors, and layouts.

Through this practice, I have gained a deeper understanding of the web development process and the importance of clean and organized code. It has also allowed me to experiment with different design concepts and see firsthand how they affect the overall look and feel of a website.

While I may not be a professional web developer, I believe that learning HTML and CSS is a valuable skill for anyone interested in technology and design. By sharing my progress in this repository, I hope to inspire others to explore the world of web development and create their own projects.

So, feel free to take a look around and let me know your thoughts. I'm always eager to learn and improve, and I appreciate any feedback or suggestions you may have.

This is the book that I will be following along: HTML & CSS: Design and Build Web Sites (Jon Duckett)
